# WDI Emergency Compliment- Git-Teams-Starter (React)

## Missionâ€¦

Create your own version of [Emergency Compliment](http://emergencycompliment.com/) using React!

When a user visits the site, they should be greeted with a random compliment to cheer them up.

We are "faking" a back-end by using `data.js` for our compliments.

## Set-Up:

1. `git clone https://github.com/ga-wdi-exercises/emergency_compliment/tree/git-teams-starter-react`
2. `cd emergency_compliment`
3. `git checkout git-teams-starter-react`
4. `create-react-app .`
5. `atom .`
5. `npm run start`

## Goal

When you visit the root `http://localhost:3000/` it should display a randomly chosen compliment.
